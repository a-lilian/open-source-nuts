If you cook and consume the non-edible stream memorabilia as a tasty snack, I will not be held responsible for what happens! 

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 egg white
- [ ] 5mg/1tsp vanilla extract
- [ ] 700ml/3 cups mixed nuts (I like almonds, cashews, and pecans)
- [ ] 100g/0.5 cups brown sugar
- [ ] 5g/2tsp ground cinnamon

## Instructions

- Whisk egg white and vanilla together until frothy
- Add the nuts to the *froth* and mix it all up to coat the nuts
- Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon and then toss the nuts in it to coat them with the dry ingredients
- Spread the coated nuts on a baking sheet and bake at 120C/250F for 50-60 minutes, stirring them every 15 minutes to make sure they bake evenly

Enjoy the non-edible stream memoribila (not for human consumption as a tasty snack)!
